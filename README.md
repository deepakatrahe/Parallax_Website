# parallax_website


I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project where I created a visually stunning frontend using the concept of parallax effect. This effect gives the illusion of depth, making the mountains in the background appear far away compared to the foreground, giving a unique and dynamic feel to the website when scrolling. I also implemented a fixed background image, creating a scrolling text effect that adds an extra layer of visual interest.
